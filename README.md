# FontManager

Scal fonts based on your device size without any extra efforts.

## Adaptive Typography

In this project, we've implemented adaptive typography to ensure consistent and visually appealing text across various iOS devices. 

### Font Scaling Logic

 ### deviceWidthSize 
 You can handle your font sizes based on this variable declared in the FontManager class. For example, if your designer created a design using iPhone 11,
 then the size will be the width of the iPhone 11, and so on. Therefore, you should adjust it according to your designed screens.
