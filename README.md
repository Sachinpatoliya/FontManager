Scal fonts based on your device size without any extra efforts.

## Adaptive Typography

In this project, we've implemented adaptive typography to ensure consistent and visually appealing text across various iOS devices.

 deviceWidthSize is Your default screen width. For example, if your designer created a design using iPhone 11,
 then the size will be the width of iPhone 11 and so on. Therefore, you should adjust it according to your designed screens.
